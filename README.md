## 🚀 Overview

Welcome to my personal portfolio repository! This project serves as a digital representation of my skills, experience, and creativity as a Frontend Developer. Built with performance and aesthetics in mind, it leverages the power of **React** for a dynamic user interface and **Tailwind CSS** for rapid, responsive styling.

Now featuring a fully integrated **Night Mode** and dynamic animations!

## 💡 Key Highlights

### 🎨 Visual & Design System
*   **🌙 Night Mode:**  Seamlessly switch between Light and Dark themes with a system-aware or manual toggle.
*   **✨ Dynamic Typewriter:**  A custom JavaScript-based typing animation in the Hero section that cycles through my professional titles.
*   **🚀 Interactive Cards:**  Experience cards and project tiles feature a "Lift-on-Hover" effect for tactile feedback.
*   **Vibrant Aesthetics:** Uses a curated gradient palette (Blue, Purple, Pink) that adapts beautifully to both light and dark backgrounds.
*   **Glassmorphism & Gradients:** Incorporates modern design trends like glass effects and subtle background blurs.
*   **Responsive Layout:** A fluid grid system ensures the site looks perfect on large desktops, tablets, and small mobile screens.

### 🛠️ Technical Implementation
*   **State Management:** React Context API (`ThemeContext`) for managing global application state like theming.
*   **Component-Based Architecture:** Modular codebase with reusable components for Layouts, Sections, and UI elements.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Powered by Vite, ensuring near-instant HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and optimized production builds.
*   **Clean Code:**  Maintains a clean and organized structure with separate files for logic, content, and styling.

## 🧩 Sections Breakdown

1.  **Hero Section:** Dynamic introduction with typing effect, resume download, and social links.
2.  **About/Skills:** Visual grid of technical skills with hover effects.
3.  **Experience:** Timeline/Card-based view of professional journey and internships.
4.  **Projects:** Showcase of key projects with darker cards in night mode, tech tags, and links.
5.  **Contact:** Fully styled contact form with accessibility considerations for dark mode.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Frontend Framework:** React.js (v18+)
*   **Build Tool:** Vite
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, PostCSS, Autoprefixer
*   **Language:** JavaScript (ES6+)
