## 🚀 Overview

Welcome to my personal portfolio repository! This project serves as a digital representation of my skills, experience, and creativity as a Frontend Developer. Built with performance and aesthetics in mind, it leverages the power of **React** for a dynamic user interface and **Tailwind CSS** for rapid, responsive styling.

Since my background includes significant experience with Computer Applications (BCA) and a passion for coding, this portfolio is not just a showcase of projects but also a demonstration of my ability to build clean, maintainable, and modern web applications.

## 💡 Key Highlights

### 🎨 Visual & Design System
*   **Vibrant Aesthetics:** Uses a carefully curated gradient palette (Blue, Purple, Pink) to create an energetic and professional look.
*   **Glassmorphism & Gradients:** Incorporates modern design trends like glass effects and subtle background blurs.
*   **Custom Animations:** Features custom CSS animations for entrance effects, hover states, and typewriter effects to engage the user.
*   **Responsive Layout:** A fluid grid system ensures the site looks perfect on large desktops, tablets, and small mobile screens.

### 🛠️ Technical Implementation
*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The codebase is modular, with separate components for Hero, Skills, Projects, Experience, and Contact sections, promoting reusability.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Powered by Vite, ensuring near-instant HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and optimized production builds.
*   **Interactive Elements:** Hover effects on cards, buttons, and links provide immediate visual feedback.
*   **Custom Assets:** Integrated custom profile images and optimized assets for fast loading.

## 🧩 Sections Breakdown

2.  **About/Skills:** a visual grid of technical skills with a unique glowing hover effect.
3.  **Experience:** A timeline or card-based view of my professional journey and internships.
4.  **Projects:** Showcasing key projects with descriptions, tech stacks, and links to live demos/repos.
5.  **Contact:** A simple and accessible way for recruiters and collaborators to reach out.
